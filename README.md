# Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM
This repository contains the code for our Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, a diffusion model for 3D pathological fetal and neonatal brain MRI synthesis from 3D segmentation maps.

The work focuses on improving segmentation of pathological regions in fetal and neonatal brain MRI by synthesizing pathological training data from healthy scans. This approach addresses the limited availability of annotated pathological data by leveraging generative methods for data augmentation.

The Giff below shows modified pathological label maps derived from healthy labels, wherefrom the pathological synthetic MRI are synthesized.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Development

The code is currently under development and will be publicly released upon publication of our manuscript:
"Pathological MRI Segmentation by Synthetic Pathological Data Generation in Fetuses and Neonates" (under review).
